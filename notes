TODO:
* function to figure out the wiki's creation date (get the home page's first revision date?)
* ability to view wiki at X /days/ after creation
* you can hard-code a ceiling date so that coders don't have discrepencies anymore



* fix the javascript api caller so that it actually gets json data and we're not just using dummy data any more.
* fix the page-changer (the drop-down after "Get history"--it doesn't work right now)
* fix the "Change from prev" button--it doesn't work right now
** just construct the right query str to get the diff view in the iframe
* write the prev_rev function



planning:

client goal:
    web interface for researcher 
        render wiki as it appeared at x days after creation
        dinner
    "interface mod"
