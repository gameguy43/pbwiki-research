TODO:
* fix the javascript api caller so that it actually gets json data and we're not just using dummy data any more.
* fix the page-changer (the drop-down after "Get history"--it doesn't work right now)
* fix the "Change from prev" button--it doesn't work right now
** just construct the right query str to get the diff view in the iframe
