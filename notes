TODO:
* fix the javascript api caller so that it actually gets json data and we're not just using dummy data any more.
* fix the page-changer (the drop-down after "Get history"--it doesn't work right now)
* fix the "Change from prev" button--it doesn't work right now
** just construct the right query str to get the diff view in the iframe



planning:

client goal:
    web interface for researcher 
        render wiki as it appeared at x days after creation
        dinner
    "interface mod"


Thursday call with Justin:
Thu Mar 25 13:20:27 EDT 2010
Questions:
 *  How do you feel about a left frame with list(s) rather than dropdown?
    A: Sure! Do it if it makes sense
 *  for (1), how do you feel about next, prev, and diff (from prev) instead of just "next" which sometimes shows a page and sometimes shows a diff?
    A: How about a checkbox that changes next to Next (with diffs) {rev2, diff 2 > 3, rev3, diff 3 > 4, rev4}
Needs:
 *  List of coded wiki URL's
    A: Justin is sending now
 *  optional: list of all edu wiki's
    A: Sending, but gmail is iffy.  Also PBworks may not want this published 
 *  Licenses of all code? Copyright currently retained in exisiting code, python is actually harvard's, html is ???
    A: Justin controlls license, collaborating in the open is fine for now via github
    Eventually everything will be released under the correct licenses, expect bsd or better
