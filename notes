Thursday call with Justin:

Questions:
 *  How do you feel about a left frame with list(s) rather than dropdown?
    A: Sure! Do it if it makes sense
 *  for (1), how do you feel about next, prev, and diff (from prev) instead of just "next" which sometimes shows a page and sometimes shows a diff?
    A: How about a checkbox that changes next to Next (with diffs) {rev2, diff 2 > 3, rev3, diff 3 > 4, rev4}
Needs:
 *  List of coded wiki URL's
    A: Justin is sending now
 *  optional: list of all edu wiki's
    A: Sending, but gmail is iffy.  Also PBworks may not want this published 
 *  Licenses of all code? Copyright currently retained in exisiting code, python is actually harvard's, html is ???
    A: Justin controlls license, collaborating in the open is fine for now via github
    Eventually everything will be released under the correct licenses, expect bsd or better
